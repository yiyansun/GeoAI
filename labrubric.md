**📢 Lab Rubric: How It Works for All Labs**

Hi everyone,

Each lab is worth **10 points total**, broken down into:

- **5 points for Coding Experiments** 
- **5 points for Written Reflection**

We divide the points **evenly** across the tasks in each section:

* For example, if there are **3 coding experiments**, each is worth about **1.67 points** (5 ÷ 3).
* If you answer **2 reflection questions**, each is worth **2.5 points**; if you answer more, the points are divided accordingly.

Your score reflects **both completeness and thoughtfulness** — so aim for clarity, clean code, and meaningful reflection.
