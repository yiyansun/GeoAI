<img src="res/geoai.png" align="right" width="36%" target="_blank" />  This course explores the emerging field of Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI), focusing on the integration of machine learning, deep learning, and large language models (LLMs) in the context of geographic data. Students will engage both technically and critically with the tools and concepts shaping the future of spatial and placial analysis. This crush course emphasizes hands-on lab experimentation, paper-driven learning, and critical reflection on the social and epistemological implications of AI-powered geospatial technologies.

The course is both reading- and lab-driven, structured to balance technical engagement with critical reflection. Each week begins with a set of approximately three assigned readings, where students are encouraged to engage actively by bringing in real-world examples and posing critical questions. Most readings are available in the “readings” folder of the course GitHub repository; if not, they can typically be accessed through the UW Library system. Lab sessions are guided but self-directed, offering space for open experimentation, problem-solving, and reflective analysis. You are required to complete four out of the seven total labs: choose either Lab 1 or 2 for Week 1, Lab 3 or 4 for Week 2, Lab 5 or 6 for Week 3, and complete Lab 7 for Week 4. Additionally, one quiz will be assigned each week during the first three weeks, and the final essay is due by the end of Week 4. **New to Google Colab? No worries—check out [this tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/) to get started.**

### Computational skill

This course welcomes students who some computational experience, or have programmed in a python or javascript IDE (Integrated Development Environment), especially Google CoLab. Students should at least hear of GIS, GitHub, LLMs before considering this course, and most importantly, be self-motivated to solve a research question with the listed computational skills.

### GitHub

This course material will be hosted on GitHub instead of UW Canvas. On this dedicated GitHub repository for this course, you can find most of the course material, participate in group discussions by submitting GitHub issues, and creating new GitHub repositories to turn in practical exercise deliverables. By the end of this quarter, you will be more proficient in operating a cloud-based coding environment and able to host your work online as a way to gain public and peer attentions.

### Quizzes

There will be **three short quizzes** administered throughout the course to assess your foundational understanding of key GeoAI concepts. Each quiz aligns with the major technical focus of the corresponding week:

- **Week 1 Quiz:** Focuses on **machine learning fundamentals**, especially as introduced in the selected chapters from the book **Python machine learning**.
- **Week 2 Quiz:** Covers **deep learning basics**, guided by the technical content in the assigned deep learning chapters from the book **Python machine learning**.
- **Week 3 Quiz:** Centers on the core concepts behind **large language models (LLMs)**, drawing from technical materials from the book **Understanding large language models**.

These quizzes are **open-note**, **untimed**, and designed to be approachable. They will include a mix of multiple-choice, short answer, and code interpretation questions, but **will not require advanced mathematics**. The primary goal is not to test memorization or complex calculations, but to help you **solidify a general understanding** of how machine learning, deep learning, and LLMs work in the context of geospatial data. Think of them as low-stakes checkpoints that prepare you for more hands-on, applied lab work in later weeks.

### Lab Exercises

Over the course of four weeks, students are required to complete **four out of seven total hands-on lab assignments**. Each lab focuses on applying machine learning, deep learning, or large language models (LLMs) to geospatial data, using **Google Colab** as the development environment. All labs involve writing and executing Python code. Your code should be **clearly organized, well-commented, and fully reproducible**. Final versions of your labs must be submitted via **GitHub**, accompanied by a short `README` file that explains the **objective**, **approach**, and **key outcomes** of your work. To allow for flexibility while ensuring coverage of core topics, you will follow this structure:

- **Week 1:** Complete **either Lab 1 or Lab 2**
- **Week 2:** Complete **either Lab 3 or Lab 4**
- **Week 3:** Complete **either Lab 5 or Lab 6**
- **Week 4:** Complete **Lab 7 (required)**

These labs are designed not only to build technical proficiency, but also to promote **critical reflection** on the design, application, and implications of GeoAI methods.

💡 **Tip:** Treat each lab as both a technical experiment and a space for critical thinking—consider not just *how* the models work, but *why* they matter in geographic contexts.

### Reading Reflection

Your weekly reading reflection should be at least **350 words** in length and must **critically engage with the specific paper(s) assigned for that week**. The required papers are clearly listed in the course schedule—please make sure your reflection is centered on those. There is no fixed structure you must follow—feel free to experiment with tone and format—but ensure your writing is clear, well-organized, and free of typos. Be sure to cite your sources appropriately. 

Here are some suggestions to help guide your writing:

- While a formal essay structure isn’t necessary, clarity, coherence, and a clear point of view are essential.
- Avoid merely summarizing the text. Instead, develop your own insights and connect them to both the readings and the week’s lab activities.
- Go beyond surface-level observations. Aim to make one or more well-developed arguments or reflections.
- Use examples and direct quotations from the readings to support your points. Well-chosen quotes can strengthen your analysis.
- Focus on intellectual engagement with the text rather than personal feelings. Whether you liked the reading is secondary to what you learned or questioned.
- Draw connections between the readings and broader course themes, and most importantly, explore your own critical ideas about the assigned paper(s).

### Final Essay

The final essay is due at the end of **Week 4** and should be between **2,500 and 3,000 words** (not exceeding 5,000 words in total). This assignment functions as a **research proposal**, where you synthesize technical skills with critical reflection to explore a topic related to GeoAI.

You are encouraged to choose either a proposal topic that critically investigates **GeoAI technologies themselves** (e.g., hallucinations in LLMs applied to spatial data, model bias, or AI's environmental footprint); **or** A project that uses **GeoAI methods to study a broader social, environmental, or spatial issue**, where you also reflect on the implications and challenges of applying AI to that issue. In either case, the goal is to demonstrate your ability to combine technical application with critical inquiry. The essay must incorporate **at least two technical sources and two critical sources**, which can come from course readings or your own independent research.

While preliminary results are welcome, they are **not required**. What we are primarily looking for is a **thoughtful, well-structured proposal** that includes:

- A **clear research question or problem statement**
- A plan for **data collection** (what data, how to obtain it, and why it's appropriate)
- The **methods or models** you propose to use (e.g., random forests, CNNs, LLMs)
- An outline of how you intend to perform **evaluation and validation**
- A section on **critical reflection**: What social, ethical, or epistemological implications does your project raise?

This essay is not just about applying a method, but about showing how you understand and contextualize that method within real-world geographic, social, or environmental challenges.

### Evaluation

Your final grade will be based on the following components:

| Component               | Weight |
| ----------------------- | ------ |
| Lab Assignments (4)     | 40%    |
| Final Essay             | 25%    |
| Reading Reflections (3) | 26%    |
| Quizzes (3)             | 9%     |

Each component is designed to balance technical practice with critical engagement. Completing all required pieces on time and with care is essential for success in the course.

### Equity & Inclusivity

Our very highest priorities include creating a brave and supportive class environment where each of us contributes, we can ask big questions, we give and receive critiques in a supportive way, we notice and engage the ways that we are differently situated within past and present relationship of power, privilege and oppression. I invite you to think hard about how race, gender identity, religion, age, citizenship status, first language, ability, sexuality, class, and other axes are at work in our interactions, and what this might mean in terms of when to speak up, when to step back, how to listen, and much more. Each of you is a welcome and invaluable part of our collective whole.
