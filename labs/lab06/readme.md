# Prompting Geospatial Reasoning: Understanding Space and Place with Gemini

> Bo Zhao | zhaobo@uw.edu | Department of Geographhy, University of Washington - Seattle

This lab explores how large language models (LLMs)—specifically Google Gemini—can be prompted to extract geospatial and semantic information from narrative texts. You will analyze a walking tour chapter of Seattle's Capitol Hill and generate structured location data that includes not only names and coordinates, but also cultural and emotional attributes such as sense of place and rhetorical framing.

By comparing LLM outputs with traditional geocoding methods, you will assess how well Gemini “understands” both spatial structure and placial meaning. This lab combines prompt engineering, mapping, and critical reflection on AI’s ability to interpret geography.

You will:

- Design a structured prompt to extract 16 features from a narrative PDF
- Run Gemini Flash 2.0, Gemma, and Gemini 2.5 Preview to compare model behavior
- Parse model output and visualize on an interactive Folium map
- Reconstruct the same map using traditional geocoding (ArcGIS) from a manually curated CSV
- Compare results in terms of location accuracy and semantic richness
- Reflect on how prompt structure affects geospatial reasoning and place interpretation

> **Guiding question:** How does prompt engineering shape an LLM’s ability to "read" geography and understand place?

### Coding Experiments

Try one or more of the following:

- Revise the prompt (e.g., remove fields or examples). How does Gemini respond?
- Compare outputs from different models. Which performs best, and why?
- Add or modify place descriptions. Can Gemini reason with customized input?
- Analyze map error: Which locations are misrepresented, and what might explain this?

### Written Reflection

At the end of your lab, please answer **at least two** of the following questions (300–500 words total):

1. How does prompt specificity affect the quality of spatial extraction?
2. In what ways does Gemini succeed or fail in expressing "sense of place"?
3. How does LLM-based mapping differ from rule-based geocoding?
4. What are the implications of letting LLMs narrate geography?

## ✅ Deliverables

Your submission must include **two parts**:

1. **Coding Experiments**: Add your prompt tests, maps, and comparisons to the notebook.
2. **Written Reflection**: Answer the reflection questions in a clearly labeled markdown cell or submit a separate text file.

Please export both parts into a **PDF or Word document** and submit to **Canvas** by the posted due date.

**Note:** Lab assignments must be submitted electronically to Canvas by the due date. Late submissions will incur a 10% penalty per day unless prior notice is given for valid reasons such as illness, academic conflicts, or personal emergencies. Flexibility is possible with timely communication, but make-up exams or extensions will only be granted in documented, exceptional cases.
